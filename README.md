# TODO MVSSW

This is my "TODO Model-View-Something-Something-Whatever" project.

It's like [TODO MVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc), only with
more something and a lot of whatever.

The idea is to build a "TODO List" app using different technologies
(languages, frameworks, databases, whatever...) to get an idea of how
much they suck, and in what specific ways.

The app should have just enough functionality to seem possibly useful,
without actually being usefull in any way at all.
